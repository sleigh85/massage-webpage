                <h2 class="title">About Medical Massage</h2>
                <p class="section__text-words">
                    Everyone knows that massage is great way to relax and reduce stress
                    but it can also be used to help alleviate pain and improve medical issues
                    related to posture, nerve compression, muscle guarding, and much more. A certified
                    medical massage therapist has been trained to spot, test for, and treat muscular
                    issues that often times leave people suffering needlessly because they write the
                    pain off as them just aging or accept it as the new norm after searching for and not
                    finding relief or answers from their doctor. 
                    In fact many doctors and physical therapists now refer their patients in for medical
                    massage, both when a specific cause can't be identified, and as part of the rehabilitation
                    process.

                <h2 class="title">Your First Session</h2>
                <p class="section__text-words">
                    At your first session, the massage therapist will ask about your area of discomfort,
                    and any diagnoes related to the discomfort. They will also ask about your medical history
                    and any medications that you are taking to ensure that the massage techniques used are safe
                    for you. They may do some quick assesments to check your posture, muscle engagement, and 
                    range of motion. If the therapist incoorporates multiple tools or modalities into
                    their sessions, they will go over each and make sure that you are comfortable with any that 
                    they use. They should also go over a pressure level scale with you to ensure that 
                    you are recieving the correct pressure for an effective massage.<br>
                    Once you are on the table and the session has started don't hesitate to communicate 
                    when working on an area feels painful, or creates a weird sensation. After the session 
                    your therapist will create a care plan that you can request if you ever need to. The care 
                    plan will include their findings and recommendations for treatment, achievable goals they
                    aim for by the end of your treatment period, and any exersizes or recommendations that they
                    advise you to follow. Care plans are updated at the end of every session and are a good indicator
                    for how well massage therapy is working for you.

                <h2 class="title">The Final Outcomes</h2>
                <p class="section__text-wordst">
                    A lot of the problems that we encounter are caused or aggrevated by the things that we do everyday so
                    once your goals have been met and your care plan completed you will still need to follow any
                    recommendations you've been given to keep the problem from returning in the future. These 
                    recommendations usually include specific stretches or movements, and regular maintenance 
                    massages are usually suggested monthly.
